//! Streaming output sanitizer for [`OutputCapability::Filtered`] containment mode.
//!
//! In the `Containment` tier of the four-mode policy, the hosted program is
//! assumed hostile. Raw escape sequences it emits can be used to:
//!
//! - Rewrite the clipboard (`OSC 52`)
//! - Spoof the window title (`OSC 0`/`OSC 1`/`OSC 2`)
//! - Inject arbitrary hyperlinks (`OSC 8`)
//! - Encode tmux passthrough / Sixel / Kitty image data (DCS)
//! - Run generic application program commands (APC — used by terminal AI
//!   features in some emulators and unsafe to trust from a hostile agent)
//! - Probe or respond to status sequences via SOS/PM strings
//!
//! This module implements a deliberately conservative, first-wave
//! sanitizer that **strips all OSC, DCS, APC, SOS, and PM sequences**
//! before the bytes reach the terminal emulator or the attached clients.
//!
//! # What is stripped (dropped from the stream)
//!
//! - Operating System Command sequences: `ESC ]` … `BEL` or `ESC ]` … `ST`
//! - Device Control Strings: `ESC P` … `ST`
//! - Application Program Commands: `ESC _` … `ST`
//! - Start Of String strings: `ESC X` … `ST`
//! - Privacy Message strings: `ESC ^` … `ST`
//!
//! # A note on C1 single-byte introducers (0x80-0x9F)
//!
//! Modern terminals run in UTF-8 mode, where the byte range 0x80-0xBF is
//! reserved for UTF-8 continuation bytes. The aterm parser follows this:
//! by default `c1_controls_enabled = false`, so naked 0x90/0x9D/0x9F
//! bytes are ignored by the terminal emulator itself. To avoid corrupting
//! legitimate UTF-8 text (where, e.g., the emoji 🌍 encodes as `F0 9F 8C
//! 8D` and contains 0x9F as a continuation byte), this sanitizer matches
//! the emulator's default and does **not** treat naked C1 bytes as
//! sequence introducers. Only the 7-bit ESC-prefixed forms
//! (`ESC ]`, `ESC P`, `ESC X`, `ESC ^`, `ESC _`) are stripped. This is
//! consistent with xterm's and Terminal's behavior in UTF-8 mode.
//!
//! If a future deployment enables C1-controls-in-parser, the sanitizer
//! must be extended to match — but doing so unconditionally here would
//! break UTF-8 text, which is the worse of two failure modes (silent
//! text corruption vs. ignoring a rare and parser-disabled code path).
//!
//! # What is preserved (passes through)
//!
//! - Printable bytes (text, UTF-8 content)
//! - C0 controls (0x00-0x1F including CR, LF, TAB, BS, ESC)
//! - CSI sequences (`ESC [` … final byte) — needed for cursor movement,
//!   SGR styling, erase operations
//! - ESC sequences without an intermediate OSC/DCS/APC/SOS/PM role
//!   (e.g. `ESC 7` save cursor, `ESC =` keypad, `ESC \\` String Terminator
//!   when encountered standalone)
//! - DEL (0x7F)
//!
//! # Trade-offs
//!
//! This is a **deny-OSC/DCS/APC/SOS/PM** sanitizer, not a full allowlist.
//! CSI sequences pass through even though some CSI variants can still be
//! annoying (e.g. cursor teleportation, scroll-region abuse). A stricter
//! allowlist sanitizer is tracked as follow-up work; this module is the
//! minimum viable replacement for the silent no-op that previously lived
//! in `aterm-daemon/src/session/reader.rs` (#7901).
//!
//! # Streaming guarantee
//!
//! The sanitizer processes bytes incrementally. A sequence split across
//! multiple [`OutputSanitizer::sanitize`] calls is still fully stripped.
//! This matches how PTY bytes arrive: a single `OSC 52;c;<payload> BEL`
//! may span multiple 4 KiB reads.
//!
//! # Fail-closed property
//!
//! If the sanitizer is mid-OSC/DCS/APC/SOS/PM when a call returns, the
//! partially-stripped state is carried into the next call. No bytes from
//! a stripped sequence are ever emitted, even on premature stream end or
//! mid-byte truncation.
