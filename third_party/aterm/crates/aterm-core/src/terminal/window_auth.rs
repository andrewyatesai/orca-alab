//! Window-operations capability — structural gate on XTWINOPS dispatch.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Privilege-conflation finding CF-008 (see
//! [`reports/2026-04-18-privilege-conflation-audit.md`]) identified the
//! XTWINOPS (`CSI t`) handler as a sink that dispatches attacker-chosen
//! window geometry/state operations to a host-installed callback
//! ([`super::handler::TerminalHandler::invoke_window_callback`]). Whether
//! a given PTY-origin sequence is allowed to reach the callback is
//! distinguished only by the runtime boolean [`TerminalModes::allow_window_ops`].
//!
//! A point-patch in #7876 (CSI 20t / 21t bypass of the deny branch) showed
//! the antipattern from [design doc] — "a new sequence is one forgotten
//! `if !allow_window_ops` check away from reopening the class". The
//! structural fix is to make the *type* of `invoke_window_callback`
//! refuse to compile when the caller did not first prove the host is
//! authorizing window ops.
//!
//! # The structural gate
//!
//! [`WindowOpsCapability`] is a zero-sized token whose only constructor
//! is [`WindowMintAuthority::try_mint`], a `pub(super)`-scoped function
//! that returns `Some(WindowOpsCapability)` iff the caller passed
//! `allow_window_ops = true`. The minting authority is itself a
//! zero-sized unit struct and has no runtime state — it exists solely
//! to funnel the bool through a single typed choke-point.
//!
//! Every call site that reaches
//! [`super::handler::TerminalHandler::invoke_window_callback`] must
//! receive a `&WindowOpsCapability`. Because the type's internal field
//! is private and the constructor is `pub(super)`, no code outside the
//! terminal module can name — much less construct — a capability. The
//! parser data path (`ActionSink` trait in [`crate::parser`]) cannot
//! reach [`WindowMintAuthority::try_mint`]: the trait only gives access
//! to `&mut dyn ActionSink`, which does not expose this type.
//!
//! # Semantics preserved
//!
//! This is a refactor, not a behavior change. The existing
//! `allow_window_ops` boolean remains authoritative and is the only
//! input to [`WindowMintAuthority::try_mint`]. When the flag is true,
//! a capability is minted and XTWINOPS subcommands 1–21 proceed per
//! the existing handler logic. When the flag is false,
//! [`WindowMintAuthority::try_mint`] returns `None` and the capability-
//! gated code paths (the `invoke_window_callback` call sites) are
//! structurally unreachable. The title-stack sub-operations (22/23),
//! which do not invoke the callback, continue to run regardless.
//!
//! # Relation to other capabilities
//!
//! - [`super::modal_auth`] — nonce-gated activation tokens for DCS
//!   modal protocols (SSH conductor, tmux control). That module is the
//!   template for capability-as-argument; this module reuses the shape
//!   but without a nonce because `allow_window_ops` is a host-policy
//!   boolean (not a claim from the PTY).
//! - `response_capability` — dispatch-scoped token proving a caller
//!   is inside a parser-originated sequence that may produce a
//!   response. Orthogonal: XTWINOPS reports typically need both tokens.

/// Zero-sized proof that the calling context is authorized to invoke
/// the window callback for an XTWINOPS dispatch.
///
/// Minted only by [`WindowMintAuthority::try_mint`] when
/// `allow_window_ops = true`. Consumers outside the terminal module

///
/// Required by [`super::handler::TerminalHandler::invoke_window_callback`]
