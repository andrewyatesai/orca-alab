//! Live config hot-reload watcher.
//!
//! A single background thread `stat()`s the user config file
//! (`config_path()` — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aterm/aterm.toml`, else
//! `~/.config/aterm/aterm.toml`) on a fixed cadence and, when its
//! modification time changes, posts a [`Wake::ConfigReload`](crate::Wake) so the
//! UI thread re-reads + re-applies the config to every live session (see
//! `App::reload_config`).
//!
//! WHY mtime-poll, not a filesystem-notification crate: this codebase is
//! hardened, dependency-conscious, and sandbox-sensitive (the `Containment`
//! mode denies reads/writes under `~/.config/aterm`). A ~500 ms `stat` loop is a
//! handful of syscalls per second on one path — negligible — and adds ZERO new
//! dependencies, no inotify/FSEvents/kqueue file descriptors, and no surprising
//! behavior under a sandbox profile. It also degrades gracefully: if the file is
//! absent or unreadable the loop simply waits for it to appear (mtime is read as
//! `None` and any later `Some` is a change), so creating the config later still
//! triggers a reload.
//!
//! Two hard rules borrowed from the notification/clipboard threads:
//!
//! 1. **Never block the UI thread.** The watcher only ever does a non-blocking
//!    `EventLoopProxy::send_event`; the actual re-read + validation + apply
//!    happens on the UI thread, which is the sole owner of the renderer, window,
//!    and per-tab engines.
//! 2. **Self-terminating.** When the proxy `send_event` fails (the event loop is
//!    gone — the app is exiting), the loop breaks and the thread ends. It also
//!    exits as soon as the proxy can't be reached, so it never outlives the app.
