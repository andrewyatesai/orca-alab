//! TLA+ specification coverage tracking for aterm formal verification.
//!
//! Provides tools to cross-reference Rust Kani proofs against TLA+ specifications,
//! tracking which TLA+ actions have corresponding Rust refinements.
//!
//! # Derived, drift-free TLA+ ([`derive`] + [`ty_model`])
//!
//! Prefer DERIVED models over hand-written `.tla`: write a bounded state machine
//! once as a Rust [`derive::Model`] (or via the [`ty_model`] macro) and the
//! `ty`-checkable spec AND the executable interpreter are generated from that one
//! source, so they cannot drift from each other or from the code. See
//! `docs/RFC-ty-embed-derived-tla.md` and the `AGENTS.md` at the repo root for the
//! workflow (Tier-0 `ty check` of the derived spec; Tier-1 conformance binding the
//! model to the real code). Existing models: [`derive::ring_model`],
//! [`derive::kernel_model`], [`derive::subscribe_model`], [`derive::snapshot_model`],
//! [`derive::transact_model`], [`derive::cursor_model`],
//! [`derive::read_image_seq_model`] (the A-3 read_image snapshot-seq protocol).

// The `ty_model!` proc-macro emits absolute `::aterm_spec::derive::*` paths so it
// works from any downstream crate. This self-alias lets aterm-spec ALSO invoke its
// own re-exported macro internally (e.g. `derive::read_image_seq_model`), so a
// derived model can be authored as `ty_model!` here, not just in dependent crates.

/// string). Gate the invocation with `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "spec-anchors"))]` —
/// exactly like `#[cfg_attr(…, refines(…))]` — so it is collected in the gate's test build
/// but byte-absent from production. Do NOT place it inside the `#[cfg(kani)]` harness module.
