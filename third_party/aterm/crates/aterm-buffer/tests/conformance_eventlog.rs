//! Tier-1 trace conformance: bind the REAL `EventLog` to the DERIVED ring spec.
//!
//! The committed specs in `aterm-spec-models/specs/` are model-checked in the
//! abstract (`ty check`) — they prove the *design* sound, but nothing ties them
//! to the *code that actually runs*. A model can be correct while the
//! implementation drifts. This test closes that gap for the bounded event-log
//! ring: it drives the genuine shipping `Surface`/`EventLog` (the same
//! `apply(&WriteCap, Edit::AppendLine(..))` path production uses), projects each
//! reachable state onto the spec variables `<<seq, lo>>`, and asks the real `ty`
//! binary to confirm every observed transition is one the spec's `Next` admits.
//! This is the "Tier 1" layer of `docs/RFC-ty-embed-derived-tla.md`: it binds
//! model <-> executable.
//!
//! SINGLE SOURCE — the spec here is NOT hand-written: it is generated from
//! `aterm_spec::derive::ring_model()`, the very same model that Tier-0
//! exhaustively `ty check`s (`aterm-spec/tests/derived_ring_ty.rs`). One Rust
//! source feeds both the exhaustive check and this conformance binding, so the
//! spec cannot drift from the model — and the model is what the projection targets.
//!
//! METHOD — strict per-transition validation. `ty trace validate --spec` strictly
//! checks a trace's INITIAL state (against `Init`) and its FIRST transition
//! (against `Next`), but past the first step it observation-matches leniently and
//! will not reliably reject a deep transition corruption. So instead of one long
//! trace, we validate EACH real transition `(prev -> next)` as its own strict
//! first transition: the derived spec's `Init` is parameterized (`Model::
//! transition_spec`, CONSTANTS `seq_init, lo_init`) and pinned to `prev`, and a
//! two-step trace `[prev, next]` is checked. A corrupted `next` (wrong seq or
//! wrong lo) is then reliably rejected — which the negative control asserts, so a
//! pass is never vacuous.
//!
//! SCOPE — two regimes are covered: the no-eviction append discipline
//! (`< Cap` appends, `lo == 1`; monotone seq, ring head tracked) AND the eviction
//! regime (`> MAX_LOG_EVENTS` appends, where `lo` advances as oldest events are
//! popped) — see `real_eventlog_eviction_conforms_to_ring_spec`. Only full
//! all-inputs refinement (any starting state, not the traced executions) remains
//! Tier-2 (MIR refinement via trust-mc), per the RFC.
//!
//! `ty` is located as `aterm-spec-models`' model-check test does. VERIFICATION
//! GATE (honesty ratchet): absent `ty`, these conformance tests FAIL by default —
//! a missing checker must NEVER let the model<->code binding report `ok`. The ONLY
//! non-failing absent-`ty` outcome is the explicit opt-out `ATERM_ALLOW_SKIP_TY=1`,
//! which skips VISIBLY. `ATERM_REQUIRE_TY=1` is still honored (hard fail) for
//! back-compat, but hard fail is now the DEFAULT.
