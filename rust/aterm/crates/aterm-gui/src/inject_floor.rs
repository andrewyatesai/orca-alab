//! **D3 — the un-bypassable self-feed floor.** A process-wide token bucket on
//! control-injected input, keyed by the target session's process-local id.
//!
//! The L2 [`SelfGovernor`](../../aterm_agent/struct.SelfGovernor.html) is the
//! *rich* self-reflection policy — but it only binds a driver that links
//! `aterm-agent`. A raw control-socket client can `feed @.` in a loop without it,
//! so the **mandatory** backstop must live at the control dispatch path, where no
//! client can route around it. This is that floor: every SELF-targeted
//! input-injection verb passes [`allow`] first — `send`/`key`/`ctrl`/`feed`/
//! `mouse`/`paste` at the dispatch path (control.rs), and `feed-bin` in
//! `run_feed_bin` (it is intercepted before dispatch) — bounding the *rate* of
//! self-injection so an output→observe→
//! write→output feedback storm hits backpressure (`ERR rate`) instead of
//! saturating the engine. The cap is generous — legitimate driving (a prompt, an
//! Enter) is orders of magnitude under it — so only a runaway loop is throttled.
//!
//! Its `NoOverdraft` bound (a write is admitted only with a spare token; tokens
//! never exceed the cap) is model-checked by `inject_floor_model` (`aterm-spec`).
