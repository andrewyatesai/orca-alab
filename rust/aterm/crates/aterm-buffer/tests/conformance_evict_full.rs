//! Conformance: the real `EventLog`'s live ring satisfies the DERIVED faithful
//! ring's `EvictOldestContiguous`.
//!
//! `aterm_spec::derive::evict_full_model()` is the function-valued model whose
//! invariant `EvictOldestContiguous` (`\A n : live[n] <=> (lo =< n /\ n =< seq)`)
//! `ty` proves (Tier 0): the live region is EXACTLY the contiguous window
//! `[lo, seq]`, so eviction removes precisely the oldest event — never a hole,
//! never two. The scalar ring conformance binds only `seq`/`lo`; THIS test binds
//! the actual ring CONTENTS, by driving the genuine shipping `EventLog` past its
//! cap (so eviction fires) and checking that the set of live seqs is exactly the
//! window. A bug that evicted out of order, dropped an extra event, or left a hole
//! would violate it. Pure Rust + real code, so it always runs.
