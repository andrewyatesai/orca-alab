//! The whole point of aterm is reliable screen reading; this makes testing easy:
//! a test is just **feed input → read the screen → assert**. The same machinery
//! the introspection API exposes (`visible_content` / `row_text` / `cursor`) is
//! the test oracle. When the frontend lands, the *same* feed→read→assert pattern
//! extends to `read_image` (pixels) and the rendered UI chrome (search box,
//! scrollbar) — see ATERM_DESIGN §6.5 (the self-proving harness).
