//! Parser actions and sink trait.
//!
//! # PTY provenance (Phase 1 of #7877, issue #8005)
//!
//! Every slice-bearing argument on [`ActionSink`] and [`BatchActionSink`] is
//! wrapped in [`Provenance<_, Pty>`] (from `aterm-provenance`). This tags the
//! bytes at the type level as originating from an adversarial PTY, and the
//! Rust compiler then refuses to let them reach a `Host`-privileged sink
//! without an explicit `authorize_*` ceremony.
//!
//! The parser wraps each slice at its PTY entry point via
//! [`aterm_provenance::pty_wrap_ref`] (see `dispatch.rs`). That is the only
//! place the `Pty` tag is introduced; every downstream `ActionSink` method
//! already receives pre-tagged data.
//!
//! Implementers of `ActionSink` consume the wrapped values via `.as_ref()`
//! — the wrapper is `#[repr(transparent)]` so this is zero-cost. Scalars
//! (`u8`, `char`, `u16`, `bool`) remain unwrapped: the trait's hot paths
//! dispatch per-byte and the slice wrappers already protect the byte
//! payload carriers where escape-sequence injection is possible.
