//! Response capability — structural gate on the `send_response` sink.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Privilege-conflation finding CF-003 (see
//! `reports/2026-04-18-privilege-conflation-audit.md`) identified 31
//! escape sequences (DA1/DA2/DA3, DSR/CPR, DECRQSS, XTGETTCAP, color
//! queries, title reports, XTWINOPS geometry reports, …) that each push
//! attacker-chosen bytes into the PTY writeback buffer. Each new response
//! site is one forgotten rate-limit or buffer-cap check away from a
//! DSR/DA amplification attack or fingerprint leak.
//!
//! Phase 1 (commit `0313b2561`) used the exact pattern below to close
//! the Terminal-class RCE on DCS 2000 p / 1000 p:
//! `ConductorActivationToken` / `TmuxActivationToken` are zero-sized,
//! unforgeable from outside the crate, and required as an explicit
//! argument on `SshConductorMode::activate` / `TmuxControlMode::activate`.
//! The parser data path cannot construct one, so the compiler itself
//! discharges the "PTY-origin activation" class. See
//! [`super::modal_auth`] for the template.
//!
//! # The structural gate
//!
//! [`ResponseCapability`] is a zero-sized token whose only constructor
//! ([`ResponseCapability::mint_for_dispatch`]) is `pub(super)` to the
//! terminal module and is called only from the `ActionSink` dispatch
//! entry points in `handler_actions.rs`. Every response-producing
//! handler receives `&ResponseCapability` as an explicit argument and
//! calls [`super::handler::TerminalHandler::send_response`] which takes
//! `&ResponseCapability`. A handler that forgets — or a future feature
//! that calls `send_response` without a capability — fails to compile.
//!
//! Because `ResponseCapability::mint_for_dispatch` is `pub(super)` to
//! the terminal module, the set of places that can originate a
//! response is bounded by the shape of the type.
//!
//! # Relation to rate limiting
//!
//! The capability is an *authorization* gate ("this call is inside a
//! parser-dispatched response-generating sequence"), not a *policy* gate.
//! Rate limiting continues to live on
//! [`super::response_rate_limiter::ResponseRateLimiter`] and the
//! [`super::MAX_RESPONSE_BUFFER_SIZE`] cap, both of which run inside
//! `send_response` regardless of whether a capability is present. The
//! capability cannot relax those — it only proves that a response *may*
//! be attempted at all.
