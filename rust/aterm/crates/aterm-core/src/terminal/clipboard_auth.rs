//! Clipboard-access capability authority — host-side authorization for
//! OSC 52 clipboard *set* and *query* operations.
//!
//! # The privilege-conflation problem
//!
//! OSC 52 lets a program write (`OSC 52 ; c ; <base64> ST`) and read
//! (`OSC 52 ; c ; ? ST`) the system clipboard. The parser delivers these
//! sequences through `ActionSink::osc_dispatch` like any other escape
//! sequence, so the clipboard callback in `Terminal::handle_osc_52_set`
//! and `Terminal::handle_osc_52_query` sees attacker-controlled bytes
//! (a `cat malicious.txt` from the PTY) as bit-identical to a legitimate
//! host-driven clipboard write. See
//! `reports/2026-04-18-privilege-conflation-audit.md` — **CF-004** and
//! **CF-005**.
//!
//! Prior state:
//! * OSC 52 *set* was **ungated** — any PTY-origin bytes could reach the
//!   host's clipboard delegate (CF-004).
//! * OSC 52 *query* was gated by a **runtime bool** (`allow_osc52_query`)
//!   that lived on `TerminalModes`. A refactor that moved the check or a
//!   new clipboard-query sequence that forgot to check it would silently
//!   re-open the hole (CF-005).
//!
//! # The structural fix — mirror of [`super::modal_auth`]
//!
//! Clipboard invocation sites no longer take a `&mut ClipboardCallback`
//! directly. They call [`ClipboardAuth::try_mint_write_capability`] or
//! [`ClipboardAuth::try_mint_query_capability`], each of which returns
//! `Option<ClipboardWriteCapability>` / `Option<ClipboardQueryCapability>`.
//! These types are **zero-sized with a private `_seal: ()`** — no code
//! outside this module can construct one.
//!
//! Authorization is set by the host:
//!
//! * [`ClipboardAuth::authorize_write`] / [`revoke_write`]
//! * [`ClipboardAuth::authorize_query`] / [`revoke_query`]
//!
//! Exposed on [`super::Terminal`] as
//! `authorize_clipboard_access` / `revoke_clipboard_access`. Like
//! `ModalProtocolAuth`, the `ClipboardAuth` field is reachable from the
//! parser handler (so [`try_mint_write_capability`] can be called from
//! inside `handle_osc_52_set`), but the **authorize/revoke** methods are
//! `pub(crate)` and never called from handler code — they are reached
//! only through the host-facing `Terminal::authorize_clipboard_access`
//! API. The parser therefore has no structural path to escalate itself
//! from "no authorization" to "has capability": the only transition is
//! through a host API call, which is the definition of the trust
//! boundary.
//!
//! # Why zero-sized capabilities (and not an enum returned by a gate
//! function)?
//!
//! The zero-sized token pattern matches `modal_auth` for consistency and
//! for the same reason: the token's lifetime statically flows from the
//! authorization check to the callback invocation. A future reviewer who
//! inlines the `if let Some(cap) = ...` block and forgets to check the
//! capability will get a compiler error (`cap` is unused); a future
//! handler that calls `clipboard.callback` directly (bypassing the
//! capability) will see the callback hidden behind a private helper that
//! demands a token.
//!
//! # Default posture
//!
//! Fresh terminals start with both capabilities **revoked**. Hosts must
//! opt in. This matches the existing `allow_osc52_query` default
//! (`false`) and tightens the previous-default OSC 52 *set*, which was
//! effectively "allowed iff a clipboard callback is set."
