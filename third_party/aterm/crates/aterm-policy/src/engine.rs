//! Policy engine: precompiled decision tree + `PolicyEngine::evaluate`
//! implementing §4.2 of `designs/2026-04-19-osc-policy-engine.md`.
//!
//! The engine is the runtime consumer of [`Policy`]. It
//!
//! 1. Pre-compiles every [`Rule::sequence`] selector string into a
//!    [`SequenceSelector`] at construction time.
//! 2. Buckets the compiled rules by `(function, major)` so evaluation can
//!    narrow the candidate list to a handful of rules before walking them in
//!    declared order.
//! 3. Walks the matching bucket plus the wildcard bucket top-to-bottom,
//!    applying the §4.2 algorithm: first rule whose selector matches **and**
//!    whose `origin_min` is dominated by the caller-supplied origin wins.
//!    Rules that match by selector but fail the origin gate **do not**
//!    short-circuit — evaluation continues.
//! 4. If no rule matches, returns `policy.defaults.unmatched`.
//!
//! Rules whose selector string fails to parse are treated as never-matching
//! (fail-closed at the rule level). A fully malformed TOML is handled upstream
//! by [`crate::Policy::from_toml_or_hardened`] which returns the Hardened
//! profile and `fell_back = true`.
//!
//! # Totality
//!
//! Evaluation never panics, never allocates on the hot path (the result is a
//! [`Copy`] [`Response`]), and always returns a defined value — including
//! when the rule list is empty or every rule's selector failed to compile.
//! This is codified by the §8.1 Kani harnesses in this module.
//!
//! # Rate limits
//!
//! Rate-limit enforcement lands in #7995. The engine exposes the matched
//! [`Rule`]'s `rate_limit` field to the caller via [`Decision::rate_limit`]
//! so the handler site can consult the bucket. The engine itself only
//! decides response + rate-limit id; it does not own bucket state.

// Under Kani verification we substitute `HashMap` with `BTreeMap` so the
// model checker does not hit the unsupported `CCRandomGenerateBytes` call
// that `HashMap`'s default randomised hasher makes on macOS. Production
// builds keep the `HashMap` for its better expected performance on small
// rule sets. The two types share the `.get / .entry / .or_default / .push`
// surface used by this module so the engine code is otherwise identical.
