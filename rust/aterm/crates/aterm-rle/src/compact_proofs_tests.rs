//! Kani proofs for RLE compact and compact_around correctness.
//!
//! The 19 existing proofs in `proofs.rs` exercise compact indirectly through
//! set/set_range, but 10/19 fail (killed/timeout/OOM) because CBMC struggles
//! with the combined splice + compact + rebuild_prefix_sums paths.
//!
//! These proofs verify compact and compact_around in ISOLATION by constructing
//! Rle instances with deliberately uncompacted runs (adjacent duplicates) and
//! verifying the merge logic directly.
