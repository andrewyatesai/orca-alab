//! Conformance (Tier-1): the REAL `Terminal::cell_frame` + `damage_epoch` /
//! `take_damage` path obeys the DERIVED snapshot-seq protocol (REARCH A-3).
//!
//! `aterm_spec::derive::read_image_seq_model()` is the drift-free model of the
//! read_image snapshot-seq contract: monotone seq, snapshot internal-consistency
//! (no torn read), staleness-detectable — `ty` PROVES it at `Buggy=0` and CATCHES
//! a torn read at `Buggy=1` (in `aterm-spec/tests/derived_ring_ty.rs`). This binds
//! that property to the real engine snapshot:
//!
//!   * a `cell_frame` snapshot is stamped with `damage_epoch()` (its `snapshot_seq`)
//!     captured under the one lock — the "value of seq" at snapshot time;
//!   * subsequent `process()` advances the engine (the live `damage_epoch()` grows)
//!     but does NOT mutate the already-emitted snapshot's `snapshot_seq` OR its
//!     rendered cells (no torn read / snapshot isolation);
//!   * the consumer can always tell its snapshot is behind (`damage_epoch() >
//!     snap.snapshot_seq`), i.e. staleness is detectable.
//!
//! The observed state is projected onto the model's `<<epoch, snapped, snap_seq,
//! torn>>` and checked against its actual invariants. A NEGATIVE CONTROL (a forced
//! retro-mutation of the captured seq) is shown to VIOLATE the model invariant, so
//! the pass is never vacuous. Pure Rust + real engine code, so it always runs.
