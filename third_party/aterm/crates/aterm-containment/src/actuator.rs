//! Spawn-seam containment actuator — the bridge from the policy DATA MODEL
//! (mode → [`Capabilities`](crate::Capabilities)) to a real, logged decision at
//! the one place aterm forks a child shell.
//!
//! ## What this is, honestly (`ATERM_DESIGN` §0.1 / §5.6)
//!
//! The rest of this crate is a *policy data model*: it maps a [`ContainmentMode`]
//! to a [`Capabilities`](crate::Capabilities) set whose monotonicity/non-escalation
//! is encoded as Kani proof harnesses (opt-in; a TLA+ model is planned but not yet
//! in-tree). That is a property of THAT MAPPING only — it does NOT, by itself, make
//! the operating system enforce anything; before this module nothing consulted it
//! at the spawn seam.
//!
//! This module is the actuation seam. Given the resolved mode it produces a
//! [`SpawnDecision`] that the GUI launcher consults BEFORE handing the PTY seam a
//! spawn capability. What is actuated TODAY:
//!
//! 1. **Process-capability gate (actuated).** The [`ProcessCapability`] for the
//!    mode is checked. `Full`/`Restricted`/`NoFork` all permit the *initial*
//!    interactive shell (`NoFork` means "no fork — exec only, for the initial
//!    shell"), so a normal `$SHELL` still spawns; but the decision, the mode, and
//!    the fact that it is permitted are recorded via the containment audit log.
//! 2. **Resource limits (actuated, elsewhere).** `aterm-sandbox` installs
//!    `setrlimit` bounds in the child before exec, fail-closed (`aterm-pty`).
//! 3. **OS NETWORK + SECRET-FS sandbox (actuated).** In `Containment` mode
//!    (network policy = [`None`](crate::NetworkCapability::None)) on macOS, the
//!    spawn is wrapped with `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -p <SBPL>` applying the profile
//!    from [`crate::sbpl::profile_for`] — `(version 1)(allow default)(deny
//!    network*)` PLUS a conservative `(deny file-read* file-write* …)` over a
//!    small, fixed set of SECRET directories under `$HOME` (`.ssh`, `.aws`,
//!    `.gnupg`, `.config/gh`, `.config/aterm`, `.netrc`). The kernel Seatbelt then
//!    DENIES all network access AND read/write of those credential stores to the
//!    child shell and everything it runs — while the rest of the filesystem
//!    (`~/.zshrc`, dyld, `/dev/tty`, …) stays available so a normal `$SHELL`
//!    works. [`SpawnDecision::Permit::sbpl`] carries the per-user SBPL profile so
//!    the launcher can build that wrap; the GUI fails CLOSED if the wrapper is
//!    missing (it refuses to spawn an unsandboxed shell when the policy demands the
//!    sandbox). [`os_sandbox_actuated`] is the build/platform capability check;
//!    [`network_sandbox_actuated`] reports whether the sandbox is in force for a
//!    given mode.
//!
//! What is **NOT** actuated yet (honest, deferred):
//!
//! - **GENERAL OS FILESYSTEM scoping (macOS Seatbelt `file-*` / Endpoint
//!   Security).** Beyond the conservative SECRET set above, the profile is
//!   deliberately `(allow default)` for the filesystem: a blanket `(deny file-*)`
//!   base tight enough to be meaningful also breaks a normal `$SHELL` (dyld,
//!   `path_helper`, the user's rc, `/dev/tty`). Scoping the WHOLE filesystem per
//!   [`FsCapability`](crate::FsCapability) is an explicit FOLLOW-UP. The audit log
//!   and [`os_sandbox_actuated`]/[`network_sandbox_actuated`] say exactly this —
//!   network: enforced; secret-dir read/write: enforced; general filesystem: not
//!   yet scoped.
//! - **Non-macOS platforms.** `sandbox-exec` is macOS-only; on other targets
//!   [`os_sandbox_actuated`] is `false` and `Containment` falls back to the
//!   rlimit + process-cap posture with an explicit audit line (a Linux
//!   seccomp/Landlock lane is the follow-up there).
//!
//! The policy model's intended formal spec is a `tla/Containment.tla` model
//! (planned, NOT yet in-tree; the in-tree checks are the Kani harnesses); see
//! `ATERM_DESIGN` §5.6.
