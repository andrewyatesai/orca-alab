//! Extracted from `aterm-core/src/terminal/window.rs` to `aterm-types`
//! as part of #5663 terminal extraction (Part of #5663, #2341).

/// Window operation requested by CSI t (XTWINOPS) escape sequences.
///
/// These operations allow applications to manipulate and query window state.
/// The platform UI layer implements these operations through the `WindowCallback`.
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// Some operations (especially title reporting) can be used for security attacks.
/// Platforms should:
/// - Filter escape sequences from reported titles to prevent injection
/// - Consider making manipulation operations opt-in
/// - Report operations leak display information (generally safe but configurable)
