//! isolation: once a snapshot is taken, a later write must NOT leak into it
//! (`SnapshotIsolated`: `leaked = 0`; `ty` catches a leak at `Buggy=1` in
//! `aterm-spec/tests/derived_ring_ty.rs`). This binds that property to the real

//! snapshot time and is unaffected by subsequent writes to the surface. The
