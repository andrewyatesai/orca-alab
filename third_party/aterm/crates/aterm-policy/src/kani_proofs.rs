//! Kani proofs — behavioral assertions on [`PolicyEngine::evaluate`].
//!
//! These proofs verify **non-trivial** properties of the policy engine (per
//! `design doc` "Kani proof quality rule" and #7954). Each harness introduces
//! symbolic inputs via `kani::any()` and bounds them with `kani::assume`; the
//! `trust-mc` content-quality classifier (`aterm formal mc`, folded into the
//! Trust compiler) reports all four as `substantive` (verified locally
//! 2026-04-20).
//!
//! TODO: discharge under Kani. These harnesses time out on CBMC because the
//! engine builder parses every [`Rule::sequence`] string through
//! [`SequenceSelector::parse`] and populates a `BTreeMap`, which CBMC cannot
//! tractably model at the unwinding bounds available in the workspace's Kani
//! budget. Two discharge paths are tracked for the follow-up:
//!
//!   1. Swap the selector parser for a `#[cfg(kani)]` stub that returns a
//!      precompiled bucket key directly from the test — removes all string
//!      manipulation from the symbolic trace.
//!   2. Narrow the proofs to `PolicyEngine::evaluate` over a
//!      *pre-constructed* engine passed in as a `&'static` (requires exposing
//!      a `kani_test_support` path behind the `cfg(kani)` gate).
//!
//! For now, the proofs live in the `substantive / failed_needs_rerun` bucket
//! (per `docs/kani-drift-hygiene.md`) — they classify as substantive and
//! define real behavioral invariants, but a separate issue (to be filed after
//! #7998 lands) owns the discharge work.
//!
//!   1. [`policy_monotonicity`] — For every symbolic `OriginTag` and every
//!      symbolic OSC major in a bounded range, the Hardened profile never
//!      returns a response that is strictly looser than Standard, and
//!      Standard never returns a response strictly looser than Permissive,
//!      at the unmatched-default level. This codifies the §4.5
//!      `Hardened ⊆ Standard ⊆ Permissive` refinement invariant.
//!
//!   2. [`policy_fail_closed_on_unknown`] — For every symbolic OSC major
//!      that is **not** covered by the Hardened rule set, the Hardened
//!      profile returns `Response::Drop` (the fail-closed default), never
//!      `Execute`, never panics.
//!
//!   3. [`deterministic_decision_when_rules_do_not_overlap`] — For a
//!      symbolically-chosen single-rule policy whose selector matches the
//!      dispatched sequence and whose origin gate is satisfied, the engine
//!      returns exactly that rule's response (never the default, never a
//!      neighbor's response). Rules out ordering bugs and wildcard leakage.
//!
//!   4. [`serde_roundtrip_preserves_decisions`] — A policy serialized to
//!      TOML and deserialized back yields a new engine whose decision on a
//!      symbolic (sequence, origin) pair agrees with the original. Rules
//!      out serde mis-mappings that would silently shift response or origin
//!      gates across checkpoint boundaries (#7997).
