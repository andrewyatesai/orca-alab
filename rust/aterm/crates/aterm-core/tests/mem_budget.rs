//! Engine retained-heap CEILING (M2 MEM-BUDGET) — a deterministic regression gate.
//!
//! This is the self-contained, dependency-free half of the memory story (the
//! aterm-vs-alacritty COMPARISON lives in `aterm-bench/tests/memory.rs`). It pins
//! the engine's retained heap for a 24x80 grid under a committed ceiling so a real
//! regression — accidental per-cell boxing, scrollback bloat, a leak on the process
//! path — fails the build. The number is deterministic: the grid is pre-allocated,
//! cells are inline, so a full screen of SGR text retains ZERO additional heap.
//!
//! An integration test is its own crate, so the counting global allocator here does
//! NOT affect any other test or bench. The local gate runs this via `gate perf`.
//! Run directly: `cargo test -p aterm-core --test mem_budget -- --nocapture`.
