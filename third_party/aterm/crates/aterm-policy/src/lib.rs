//! OSC / escape-sequence **policy engine data model** and built-in profiles.
//!
//! This crate is the Phase 0 scaffold for the Phase 2 policy engine described
//! in `designs/2026-04-19-osc-policy-engine.md` (tracked by #7991). It
//! hosts the data model, serde derives, the three built-in profiles, the
//! decision-tree engine (#7992) and the canonical token-bucket rate limiter
//! (#7995). Remaining work lands in follow-up issues:
//!
//! * #7992 — `PolicyEngine::evaluate` + decision tree + profile pre-compilation
//! * #7993 — mirror-field invariant for the six `TerminalModes::allow_*`
//!   booleans
//! * #7994 — capability-module rewire
//! * #7995 — canonical rate-limit data & handler wiring (see [`limits`]).
//!   The `"response"` and `"palette"` entries in every built-in profile are
//!   now the authoritative source for the 64 KiB/100 KiB/s response bucket
//!   (from commit `2134b5559`) and the 16-pair OSC 4 / OSC 21 per-sequence
//!   cap (from #7883). Handler sites consult the engine's `RateLimiterSet`
//!   when one is installed via `Terminal::apply_policy_engine`, and fall
//!   back to the pre-existing legacy constants otherwise.
//! * #7996 — FFI (`aterm_policy_load_toml`)
//! * #7997 — checkpoint v4 policy serialization
//!
//! ## Profile refinement invariant
//!
//! Every profile is a complete [`Policy`] document. The three built-ins
//! satisfy the ordering `Hardened ⊆ Standard ⊆ Permissive` over the
//! unmatched-default response (§4.5 of the design, TLA+ invariant T2). See
//! [`profiles::permissive`], [`profiles::standard`], [`profiles::hardened`].
//!
//! ## OriginTag stub
//!
//! The [`OriginTag`] enum is currently stubbed inside this crate. Once #8000
//! (`aterm-provenance`) lands, this enum becomes a re-export of
//! `aterm_provenance::OriginTag` and the stub is deleted. The variants and
//! ordering are taken verbatim from the provenance design so the swap is a
//! compile-time rename only.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use aterm_policy::profiles;
//!
//! let hardened = profiles::hardened();
//! assert_eq!(hardened.schema_version, aterm_policy::SCHEMA_VERSION);
//! assert_eq!(hardened.profile, aterm_policy::Profile::Hardened);
//! ```
