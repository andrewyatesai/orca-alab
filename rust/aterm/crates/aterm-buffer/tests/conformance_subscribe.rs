//! Conformance: the real `poll()` obeys the DERIVED no-silent-loss discipline.
//!
//! `aterm_spec::derive::subscribe_model()` is the drift-free model of the
//! subscriber: a reader that has fallen behind the live ring window MUST receive
//! a `Gap` (resync), never be silently delivered events as if nothing was lost —
//! encoded as the model's `PollGap` guard `lo > cursor + 1` (and proven by `ty`,
//! with a `Buggy=1` counterexample, in `aterm-spec/tests/derived_ring_ty.rs`).
//!
//! This binds that model to the CODE THAT ACTUALLY RUNS: it drives the genuine
//! shipping `Surface::subscribe`/`poll`, projects each state onto the model
//! variables `<<seq, lo, cursor, lost>>`, and asserts the real gap-vs-deliver
//! decision equals `Model::action_enabled("PollGap", state)` — the model's own
//! guard, not a re-stated predicate. So if `poll()` ever silently delivered to a
//! behind reader (a silent loss), this test catches it. Unlike the `ty` tests,
//! this is pure Rust (the model interpreter) + real code, so it always runs.
