// Robustness fuzz for the SAFE LZ4 block decoder's DECODE LOGIC.
//
// Layering note (important — this test was previously wrong about it):
// `aterm_lz4::block::decompress_size_prepended` is a LOW-LEVEL API whose 4-byte
// little-endian size prefix is *trusted by contract* — it is the value written
// by `compress_prepend_size`, and the decoder eagerly allocates a buffer of that
// declared size (`vec![0; declared]`). Feeding it an unbounded random prefix
// therefore asks it to allocate up to ~4 GiB per call: that is the documented
// cost of the trusted-size contract, NOT a decoder bug. (An earlier version of
// this test fed unbounded prefixes here and "found" that non-bug by hanging for
// hours on multi-gigabyte allocations.)
//
// The genuine untrusted-input attack surface — cold-tier scrollback blocks read
// back from a possibly-corrupt or hostile file — goes through
// `aterm_scrollback`'s bounded wrapper, which rejects an oversized or
// bomb-ratio declared size *before* allocating (see aterm-scrollback/src/lz4.rs,
// `MAX_DECOMPRESSED_SIZE` / `MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO`); that surface is fuzzed in
// aterm-scrollback's own tests.
//
// What THIS test pins is the decoder's DECODE-LOGIC robustness: given a
// plausibly-sized output budget (as every real caller supplies), a corrupt or
// truncated compressed body must only ever return `Ok`/`Err` — never panic, and
// never read out of bounds — because a panic in the decode path is a
// denial-of-service for a daily-driver terminal.

/// Largest declared output size this fuzz will ask the low-level decoder to
/// budget for. Bounded so the test exercises decode logic, not the trusted-size
