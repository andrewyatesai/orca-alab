//! The **Observation Kernel** (RFC "The Reactive Surface", layer L0).
//!
//! The terminal is already an event-sourced surface: every program byte folds
//! into the grid and bumps exactly one write-only logical clock,
//! [`Terminal::content_seq`](super::Terminal::content_seq). This module turns
//! *"observe this surface until condition C holds"* into a single, first-class,
//! **event-driven** primitive evaluated at the one seam where every mutation has
//! already landed — [`Terminal::post_process`] — and **latched** there so a
//! transiently-true condition can never be lost to a coalesced wake. Live deltas,
//! idle-quiescence, and semantic row matching all become *the same mechanism
//! armed with a different predicate* — never a poll loop, never a text-hash
//! scrape. Three of the four predicates (`SeqAdvanced`, `IdleFor`, `RowMatches`)
//! are OSC-133-independent — the property that makes turn-detection work for an
//! alt-screen agent TUI like Claude; `BlockComplete` is the deliberate exception,
//! exposing shell-integration block state (OSC 133/633) as a fourth predicate.
//!
//! ## One list, one path
//!
//! Every armed observer is a [`Watcher`] in ONE list, distinguished only by its
//! [`WatcherSpec`]. [`WatcherSet::observe`] evaluates all four predicate kinds in
//! one match at the seam; `IdleFor` additionally fires from [`WatcherSet::expire`]
//! at a host-supplied instant. The kernel carries no vocabulary — the regex
//! behind [`WatcherSpec::RowMatches`] is an opaque [`RowMatch`] built one crate up
//! in `aterm-observe`, so the kernel never constructs or names a regex and
//! `aterm-core` takes no **direct** `regex` dependency (it remains a transitive
//! dep via `aterm-search`'s `regex` feature; the purity test checks the direct
//! production deps).
//!
//! ## Correctness properties (model-checked and/or conformance-bound)
//!
//! 1. **No silent loss.** A predicate that holds at *any* processed batch latches
//!    at that batch, not on the consumer's later wake. Modeled abstractly by
//!    `watcher_latch_model` and behaviorally conformance-tested by
//!    `conformance_observe.rs`.
//! 2. **Deterministic idle.** `IdleFor` latches at the *exact computed deadline*
//!    (`activity_at + dur`), never the observation instant — so a live wake and a
//!    lazy replay tick latch the identical [`Satisfaction`]. This is verified by
//!    the unit + `conformance_observe` determinism tests. (`idle_deadline_model`
//!    proves a related but distinct property: the host arms the *single earliest*
//!    of all pending deadlines, via [`WatcherSet::next_deadline`].)
//!
//! ## Replay-safe by construction (IdleFor-under-replay)
//!
//! The kernel is **ephemeral, observation-only state**: it reads `content_seq`
//! and (read-only) grid rows and updates its own watcher list, but it **never
//! mutates the surface** and is **never part of a [`TerminalCheckpoint`]** — so it
//! cannot perturb the `replay_from_checkpoint_matches_live_engine` property or the
//! astream-oracle cross-check. The activity instant is the already-deterministic
//! [`process_now`](super::TransientState::process_now) reconstructed from recorded
//! `Ticks` on replay; the kernel **never reads the wall clock** (the `bell.rs`
//! caller-injects-now discipline).
