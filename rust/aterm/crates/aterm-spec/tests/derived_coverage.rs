//! The kernel-family TLA+ specs are the load-bearing correctness model of aterm's
//! buffer kernel. This test asserts each one now has a DERIVED, drift-free twin (a
//! Rust `Model` from which the spec is generated), so the hand-written `.tla` can
//! never silently diverge from the code's intended semantics. If a derived model
//! is removed or renamed, this fails — flagging that a kernel-family property
//! regressed to drift-prone hand-maintenance.
//!
//! It also prints an inventory (which specs are derived vs hand-written-only), so
//! an agent reading test output learns where the derived-model feature applies and
//! which specs are still candidates for deriving (see `AGENTS.md`).
