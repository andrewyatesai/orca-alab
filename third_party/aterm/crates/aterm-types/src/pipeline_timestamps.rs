//! Per-frame pipeline timing for keystroke-to-pixel decomposition (#5560).
//!
//! Stores durations measured at stage boundaries in the Rust processing
//! pipeline. Swift correlates these with its own absolute timestamps
//! (NSEvent → presentedTime) to produce full end-to-end latency breakdown.

/// Per-frame Rust-side pipeline timing in nanoseconds.
///
/// Durations are measured per `process()` call via `Instant::now()` deltas.
/// The render snapshot captures its own timing. Swift correlates both with
/// its endpoint timestamps to produce full keystroke-to-pixel decomposition.
///
/// All durations are nanoseconds. `process_sequence` increments on each
/// `process()` call so Swift can detect stale timestamps (render without
/// new input).
